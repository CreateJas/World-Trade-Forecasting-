# World-Trade-Forecasting-
Overview:
This project involves the analysis and forecasting of export trends using time series data. The dataset, loaded from a CSV file, is preprocessed to handle missing values and converted into a suitable format for trend analysis and forecasting.

Key Components:

Data Loading and Preprocessing:

The project starts by loading a dataset from a CSV file and handling missing values by replacing them with appropriate values, such as the mean.
Trend Analysis:

The overall export trends are analyzed using linear regression, providing insights into the average percentage change over the years.
Top Countries Analysis:

The top countries contributing to export services are identified based on the average percentage over all years. A visual representation illustrates the export trends for these top countries.
LSTM Model for Forecasting:

A Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras for time series forecasting. The model is trained on historical export data and used to predict future trends.
Country-wise Forecasting:

The LSTM model is applied to forecast export values for each country individually. The forecasts are visualized in a KDE (Kernel Density Estimate) graph, providing a clear comparison of forecasted export trends across different countries.

Visualization:

The project uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, including line plots for overall trends, bar plots for top countries, and KDE graphs for country-wise forecasting.
Conclusion:

The project aims to provide valuable insights into historical export trends, identify significant contributors, and offer forecasts for future export values. The combination of trend analysis and machine learning techniques enhances the understanding of export dynamics.
